# PersonalFinanceApplication

A personal finance web application built using C# and ASP.NET that lets user easily track their personal financial situation in ***just 3 simple steps***!

- Step 1:
User enters the period (month) that they are entering financial statement balance for. If the period already exists in the database, move on to step 2!
- Step 2:
This is the "balance sheet" step — users can enter their assets (what they own) and liabilities (what they owe) and the app will calculate their net worth for the period.
- Step 3:
Finally, this is the "cashflow statement" step — users can enter their income (inflow) and spending (outflow) for the period and the app will calculate how much they were able to save in the period.

In these 3 simple steps, users can gain a clear picture of their personal finances!
